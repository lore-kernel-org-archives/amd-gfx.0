This is v4.15 which backport Lukas' patches and also one bug fix 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/commit/?id=57cb54e53bdd.
The platform is AMDAPU(with audio) + AMD dGPU , it is a hybird GFX 
platform. In generic, dGPU will always be suspended.

This is my guess, since I do not get azx_runtime_resume() print info 
which I added. it maybe access HW during this period, but do not trigger 
audio resume progress.

Yeah, I have reviewed these code, it constructs ELD after reading EDID, 
and write them into HW buffer when set display mode.

Hi Takashi,

Not intel, but it is AMD APU+ AMD GFX, the APU has a local HDMI port for extension. And dGPU is only for offloading render via PRIME.

Originally, the HDA driver before v4.17, there is a bug, that all the audio is set to CLIENT_DIS, so the when the dGPU suspend, the audio which is bound to iGPU will also be suspend.

Now, after Lukas' patches. The audio will auto suspend. It make ubuntu audio setting could not detect HDMI audio, even if HDMI has light up.

OK, and it has all necessary patches including the one Lukas
suggested, right?

If so, figure out what you're actually seeing as "PA could not detect
HDMI audio".  For example, is it the HDMI (jack) detection (giving
false even if it's connected)?  Or is it an error at opening the given
device? Does the driver give the proper ELD bytes as well as the jack
state?

Thanks to your explanation, and see comments in line.


Do you need to runtime resume the HDA controller even if user
space isn't streaming audio?  Why, and in which situation exactly?

Jim: OEM system uses pactl to queiry audio card and audio output sink, since the audio has power down by runtime pm, so the audio card and output sink are all unavailable. they could not select the available HDMI audio for audio playing.

You're saying above that the HDA controller isn't runtime
resumed on hotplug of a display.  Is that necessary to retrieve ELD or something?
I'm not sure if there's code in the HDA driver to acquire a
runtime PM ref on HPD, but maybe it's necessary.  Or maybe the
code is there but somehow no HPD interrupt is received by the HDA driver?

Jim: So far, I do not find any code about audio response HPD in kernel. the HPD interrupt will sent to user mode via uevent, not sure whether audio user mode driver can receive the event or not.

On the gfx side at least, we can get a hotplug event via ACPI
(depending on the OEM design) if displays are attached/detached
while the dGPU is powered down.  I suppose the gfx driver could
call into the audio driver during one of those events.  On the gfx
side at least we just generate the gfx hotplug event and let userspace deal with it.

IMO, a more proper way would be to have the direct communication
between the graphics driver and the audio driver like i915 driver
does.  Then the audio driver can get plug/unplug event at more
accurate timing without races.

(Though, it will cause another mess wrt the weak module dependency,
but it's another story :)

Just don't do what snd-hda-intel did and instead implement the

1. Did you encounter similar issue before?
2. audio will auto suspend as default at beginning of boot, is
it expect behaviour?

Yes, that's expected.  Once you start streaming audio to
attached displays, user space opens the codec device and this
causes the HDA controller to runtime resume.  If the discrete
GPU is suspended at that moment, it will be powered on and kept powered on as long as user space is streaming audio.

Do you need to runtime resume the HDA controller even if user
space isn't streaming audio?  Why, and in which situation exactly?

You're saying above that the HDA controller isn't runtime
