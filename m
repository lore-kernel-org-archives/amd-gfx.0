Ugh.  Two problems here.  One is obviously that there's a patch that was
sent out only a couple of days ago with a whole bunch of tags about
internal testing and review and now you've found issues with it.  That's
worrying.

The other is that you really, really need to get more on top of upstream
process.  There have been constant problems with this driver and they
feel like they're getting worse not better, with the original send of
this the noise in the subject lines and body of the e-mail means that
what you're sending looks like a case of git send-email CCing people in
accidentally rather than a deliberate upstream submission.

The constant problems mean that even as I open the e-mail I'm expecting
to have to push back on something which isn't great and affects the way
I review things.

If you're concerned about rewriting commit logs just add a note saying
that you did so in the commit log.  Please resend normally.
