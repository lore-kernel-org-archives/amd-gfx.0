It merely assumes that the work may already have been scheduled before.

Admittedly, I missed the cancel_delayed_work_sync calls for patch 2. While I think it can still have some effect when there's a single work item for multiple rings, as described by James, it's probably negligible, since presumably the time intervals between ring_begin_use and ring_end_use are normally much shorter than a second.

So, while patch 2 is at worst a no-op (since mod_delayed_work is the same as schedule_delayed_work if the work hasn't been scheduled yet), I'm fine with dropping it.


> Something similar applies to the first patch I think,

There are no cancel work calls in that case, so the commit log is accurate TTBOMK.

I noticed this because current mutter Git main wasn't able to sustain 60 fps on Navi 14 with a simple glxgears -fullscreen. mutter was dropping frames because its CPU work for a frame update occasionally took up to 3 ms, instead of the normal 2-300 microseconds. sysprof showed a lot of cycles spent in the functions which enable/disable GFXOFF in the HW.

There was certainly a bug though, which patch 1 fixes. :)
