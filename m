I haven't really looked at them yet because I was waiting for the DRM
side of it to get sorted out (previous experience has been that DRM
changes that need review can take a while to figure out).  To be a bit
clearer about what I said in the mail you're replying to you should just
apply the initial DRM bits and send a pull request, this is a standard
way of handling cross tree stuff and means that worst case there's fewer
dependencies after the merge window.
