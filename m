Don't you have to check for

      client_id(client) != VGA_SWITCHEROO_UNKNOWN_ID | ID_BIT_AUDIO

here?  That's the value you assign when the audio client registers,
yet you're checking for something else, so you're always skipping
over audio clients.  Did you actually test this patch?

Apart from the issue above and that this approach doesn't work if
hda_intel registers after the two GPUs, some nits:

vgaswitchreoo => vga_switcheroo multiple times above and in the subject.

Please add a note here that vga_dev is bogus for GPU clients.

Readability might improve if you break the line like this:

		if (!client_is_vga(client) ||
		    client_id(client) != VGA_SWITCHEROO_UNKNOWN_ID)

Again, I'd break the line such that the two operands to the bitwise or
are on the same line:

	return register_client(pdev, ops,
			       VGA_SWITCHEROO_UNKNOWN_ID | ID_BIT_AUDIO,
			       vga_dev, false, true);
